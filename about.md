My name is cat and I like to fix things, more often than not I break them even more and then things work out alright after that.

### Why start a blog now? 

It's the new year! Hopefully 2021 is alright, I hope to update this blog throughout the year with shit I find to be interesting, but if I'm being honest I don't have much confidence in that.

If you want to get a hold of me, these are the best places to do it.
